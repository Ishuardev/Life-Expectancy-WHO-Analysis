# LIFE-EXPECTANCY-WHO-Analysis

Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. It is formally defined as an estimate of the average age that a member of a particular population will be when they die. 
Life expectancy has seen great and rapid changes in comparison to the early 1900s. The global average life expectancy has more than doubled and in 2019 is above 70 years (Roser, 2013). 
There has been great research on factors affecting the life expectancy of different countries in the world. 
Some might even argue that the advancement in the healthcare sector plays an important role in determining how long one can live. 

This report will cover the data descriptions and analysis using R language. 
For each of our research objectives, we performed statistical analysis and drew conclusions in the most appropriate approach, together with explanations and elaborations. 

Infomration on the data collected, the descriptions and metrics used is added to the file in this repository. The dataset used will also be uploaded as well
